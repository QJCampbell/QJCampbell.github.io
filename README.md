## Places I Spend my Time on the Web

When I'm not learning on [linkedin](www.linkedin.com/learning), I usually browse [Eastwood](www.eastwood.com) for automotive restoration supplies and other tools and stuff. If you are in need of tools and fabrication equipment, that's a one stop shop for the majority of your needs. The majority of my tech information comes from the sub-forums on [Reddit](www.reddit.com). If you're into bowling, I recommend you check out [bowlersmart](www.bowlersmart.com) for anything you may need. The prices are pretty good and they have low shipping rates.
